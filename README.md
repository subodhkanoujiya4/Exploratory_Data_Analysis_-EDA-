# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

# 📌 Objective
The goal is to understand the data through summary statistics and visualizations, identifying patterns, trends, and potential anomalies that could help in further predictive modeling or feature engineering.

# 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Plotly Express

#📊 EDA Includes
Basic Information
Dataset structure, missing values, and data types.
Summary Statistics
Mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles, etc.
Histograms
Distribution of numerical features like Age, Fare, etc.
Boxplots
Outlier detection across numeric features.
Correlation Heatmap
Visual relationships among numeric variables.
Pairplot
Multi-feature relationships and distribution based on Survived.
Interactive Visuals (Plotly)
Class-wise survival comparison.
Basic Inferences
Insightful points based on visual trends.

# 📁 File Structure

# 📦titanic-eda
 ┣ 📄 titanic.csv              # Dataset file
 ┣ 📄 eda_titanic.py           # Python script for EDA

# 🚀 Getting Started
# 1. Clone the Repository

git clone (https://github.com/subodhkanoujiya4/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_-EDA-.git)

# 2. Install Required Libraries

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
# 3. Run the Script

python eda_titanic.py
Make sure titanic.csv is in the same directory.

# 🔍 Sample Insights
First-class passengers had higher survival rates.
Fare and age showed notable outliers.
Age distribution was right-skewed.
Strong correlation between passenger class and survival.

# 🧠 Next Steps
Handle missing values (especially in Age & Cabin).
Feature engineering (e.g., extracting title from Name).
Predictive modeling using machine learning.

# 🚀 Run the Code
python data_cleaning_titanic.py
